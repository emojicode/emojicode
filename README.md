Emojicode is an open source, high-level, multi-paradigm
programming language consisting of emojis. It features Object-Orientation, Optionals, Generics and Closures.

## üèÅ Getting Started

**To learn more about the language and how to install Emojicode visit https://www.emojicode.org/.**

We highly recommend to follow Emojicode‚Äôs Twitter account [@Real\_Emojicode][6] to stay up with the latest.

## üî® Building from source

### üè° Building locally

Prerequisites (versions are recommendations):

- clang and clang++ 6.0.1 or gcc and g++ 7.2
- CMake 3.5.1+ and (preferably) Ninja
- LLVM 7
- Python 3.5.2+ for testing

Steps:

1. Clone Emojicode (or download the source code and extract it) and navigate
  into it:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/emojicode/emojicode
   cd emojicode
   ```

2. Create a `build` directory and run CMake in it:

   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -GNinja
   ```

   You can of course also run CMake in another directory or use another build
   system than Ninja. Refer to the CMake documentation for more information.

3. Build the Compiler and Real-Time Engine:

   ```sh
   ninja
   ```

4. You can now test Emojicode:

   ```sh
   ninja tests
   ```

5. The binaries are ready for use!
   You can the perform a magic installation right away

   ```sh
   ninja magicinstall
   ```

   or just package the binaries and headers properly

   ```sh
   ninja dist
   ```

   To create a distribution archive you must call the dist script yourself
   (e.g. `python3 ../dist.py .. archive`).

### üêã Building using Docker

A `Dockerfile` is available for building in a Ubuntu `18.04` environment.

Steps:

1. Clone Emojicode (or download the source code and extract it) and navigate
  into it:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/emojicode/emojicode
   cd emojicode
   ```

2. Build Docker image:

   ```sh
   docker build -t emojicode-build:latest .
   ```

3. Verify the installation was fine:

   ```
   ...
   ‚úÖ  Emojicode was successfully installed.
   ```

4. Start image (and mount a directory to it):

   ```sh
   docker run -v $(pwd)/code:/workspace -it emojicode-build:latest
   ```
   
5. Start coding !

   ```sh
   emojicodec /workspace/hello.üçá && . /workspace/hello
   ```
